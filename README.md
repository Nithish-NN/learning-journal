# 🧠 Daily Learning Journal

Welcome to my **Daily Learning Journal** — a space where I document my journey of continuous learning, one day at a time.

## 📅 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to capturing my daily progress as I explore various topics in tech, data, and beyond. 
Each day, I post notes, summaries, code snippets, or insights from what I learned — whether it's a new concept, a tool, or just a better understanding of something I already knew.

## 🗂️ Structure

The repo is organized in folders by **month** and then by **day**, like this:
📁 2025 ┣ 📁 04-April ┃ ┣ 📄 day01.md ┃ ┣ 📄 day02.md ┃ ┗ ... ┗ 📁 05-May ┣ 📄 day01.md ┗ ...


Each file includes:
- 📌 Topic of the day
- 🧾 Summary/Notes
- 🧪 Code snippets (if applicable)
- 💡 Key takeaways

## 🎯 Goals

- Stay consistent with daily learning
- Track progress over time
- Share knowledge with the community
- Reflect and reinforce what I’ve learned
